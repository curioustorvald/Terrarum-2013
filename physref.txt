1. Units

Length: count of block (e.g. 12 Block length). 1 Block = 2 Feet = 30 Centimeter
Weight: Kilogram.

Area: 1 Block area = 0.09 m^2
volume: 1 Block volume = 0.027 m^3 = 27 L

2. Physical properties of game item
Most of weapon's data values were taken from Dwarffortress.
Material properties were taken from Wikipedia and Wollfram|Alpha.
2-1 Tools

1. Pick
tool = true
weapon = true
battle = false
Contact area: 0.0025 m^2
Kinetic energy: 0.5*0.5 kg*2^2 (velocities are (dwarffortress' unit)/1000)

Power of swinging pick: (Kinetic energy) / (contact area)
(note: sand, dirt can be also collected with pick.)


2. Axe
tool = true
weapon = true
battle = false
Contact area: 0.0075 m^2
Kinetic energy: 0.5*0.8 kg*1.25^2

Power: (Kinetic energy) / (contact area / 1 m^2)


3. Hammer
tool = true
weapon = false
battle = false
Desc: Used for remove furniture, background wall and glass.

Contact area: 0.01 m^2
Kinetic energy: 0.5*0.4 kg*2^2

Power: (Kinetic energy) / (contact area)

(BIGNOTE: standard mass is mass of IRON (which is 1.))
(BIGNOTE2: standard sharpness(contact area) is edge of IRON (which is lovely number of 1.). Therefore, contact area is defined as: (real contact area)/(edge of material) )

2-2 Materials

1. Iron
blunt = true
edge = true
Molar mass: 1 (default)
Edge: 1 (default)



2. Gold
blunt = true
edge = false
Molar mass: 3.5 ( 196.967/55.845 )
Edge: 0.4 ( Vickers hardness 216 MPa/608 MPa )




3. Stone
blunt = true
edge = false
Molar mass: 0.5 ( 28.0855/55.845, Used silicon )
Edge: 0.7 (Mohs hardness 3+, ( Mohs 1 (47) )*10 )




4. Adamantine
blunt = false
edge = true
Molar mass: 0.4 ( 1 m^3 of diamond (3500 kg) / same volume of iron (7870 kg) )
Edge: 10 ( Dwarfforess' Adamintine max edge / Iron )


2-3 Weapons!

1. Long sword
blunt = false
edge = true
Contact area: 0.0024 m^2
Kinetic energy: 0.5 * 0.7 kg * 1^2
